			<h2>Picutre slideshow</h2>
			<p>Picture slide show with radio button to helps the users change the images with just a click.<br>They can also click on the images to navigate to the following html.<br>
			This enhancement is hard to create, I have to implement 4 picutres into 1 small box with border, create radio button.<br>
			Then marked up everything using css. For example: change the radio button outlook with hover, create action when users click on the radio button.<br>

			<h2>Image map</h2>
			<p>Image map using "embed map html link" from google map<br>
				This is an easy tecchnique, I just go to google map and find Swinburne location.<br>
				They allow us to share that location with "embed map" function. Then I copy the HTML link and put it inside "p" method.<br>

			<h2>Neon light button</h2>
			<p>Neon light buttton is more beautiful than the regular one. I add the button and make it glow up by using css.<br>
				This techinique is mainly from the "box-shadow" method. I made some research on this method and using the HTML color shades from w3schools.<br>
